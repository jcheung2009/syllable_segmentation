# syllable_segmentation
matlab code for segmenting syllables using dtw of spectral information

This respository contains code to segment song syllables in a target motif. Dependent functions can be found in my other
repository "code, which contains general matlab functions for behavioral analysis of song. These functions work on isolated 
snippets of sound containing a target motif that had been manually identified, labelled, and coarsely segmented using 
custom matlab software (evsonganaly.m). Open amplitude_vs_dtw_segmentation.ipynb to see some analyses comparing
amplitude vs dtw based segmentation.
